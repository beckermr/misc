def add_extra_des_coadd_tile_info(*, info, piff_run):
    """Read the coadd tile info, load WCS info, and load PSF info for
    the DES Y3+ DESDM layout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    info: dict
        Info dict for a coadd tile
    piff_run : str
        The PIFF PSF run to use.

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        A dictionary with at least the following keys:

            'position_offset' : the offset to add to zero-indexed image
                coordinates to get transform them to the convention assumed
                by the WCS.
            'src_info' : list of dicts for the SE sources
            'image_path' : the path to the FITS file with the coadd image
            'image_ext' : the name of the FITS extension with the coadd image
            'weight_path' : the path to the FITS file with the coadd weight map
            'weight_ext' : the name of the FITS extension with the coadd weight
                map

                mask
            'seg_path' : the path to the FITS file with the coadd seg map
            'seg_ext' : the name of the FITS extension with the coadd seg map
            'image_flags' : any flags for the coadd image
            'scale' : a multiplicative factor to apply to the image
                (`*= scale`) and weight map (`/= scale**2`) for magnitude
                zero-point calibration.
            'magzp' : the magnitude zero point for the image

        The dictionaries in the 'src_info' list have at least the

            'psfex_path' : the path to the PSFEx PSF model
            'piff_path' : the path to the Piff PSF model
            'scale' : a multiplicative factor to apply to the image
                (`*= scale`) and weight map (`/= scale**2`) for magnitude
                zero-point calibration
