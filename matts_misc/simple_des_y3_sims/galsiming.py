    """Render a list of sources for a single image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_shape : tuple of ints
        The shape of the final image.
    wcs : galsim WCS object
        The WCS for the image.
    draw_method : str
        The method used to draw the image. See the docs of `GSObject.drawImage`
        for details and options. Usually 'auto' is correct unless using a
        PSF with the pixel in which case 'no_pixel' is the right choice.
    src_inds : array-like
        A list of identifiers for each object. The entries from this list are
        fed to `src_func` in order to determine which object to draw.
    src_func : function-like
        A function with signature `gal_func(src_ind)` that returns a tuple of
            src : `galsim.GSObject` to be rendered.
            image_pos : `galsim.PositionD` the position of the object in the
                image
    n_jobs : int, optional
        The number of process to use. If None, then default to the number
        of CPUs as determined by the `loky` package in `joblib.externals`.

    Returns
    -------
    image : galsim.ImageD
        The full image with all of the sources rendered.
